# Genetic Map Construction Project: Mapping Phenology and Fruit Quality-Related Traits in a Biparental Blueberry Population
## Abstract
[TBA]

## Project Overview
This repository documents the workflow for my master's thesis project, *Mapping Phenology and Fruit Quality-Related Traits in a Biparental Blueberry Population*. The project aims to determine the presence of traits that are linked
to certain phenology and fruit quality-related traits in Blueberry (*Vaccinium sp.*) for marker-assisted selection and breeding. 
Key features of this project:
-**Analysis**: genotype calling, linkage mapping, QTL analysis
-**Tools**: Python, R, SQL
-**Data**: SNPs. Raw data is excluded due to privacy restrictions. Simulated data is provided in the repository for replication purposes.
