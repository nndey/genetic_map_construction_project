# Data Usage Disclaimer

## Raw Data Policy
The original datasets used in this project contain sensitive genomic information (SNPs) and phenotype traits. Due to privacy and ethical considerations, these raw datasets are not included in this repository. 

### Synthetic Data Policy
Synthetic datasets have been provided in the  `data/synthetic_data/` folder. These datasets are generated to resemble the original data in structure and statistical properties but do not contain any real or sensitive information. 

## Ethical Use
By accessing or using any data provided in this repository, you agree to the following:
1. You will not attempt to reverse-engineer, derive, or infer any private information about samples and their characteristics from the synthetic data.
2. You acknowledge that the synthetic data is for demonstration and educational purposes only.

For inquiries about accessing the original raw data, please contact nndeybo@ncsu.edu. Access may require prof of affiliation to North Carolina State University (and other authorized institutions) and agreement to strict data-sharing policies.

## File Overview
- `synthetic_data/synthetic_snp_data.vcf `: Simulated VCF-like data representing SNPs and genotypes across 10 samples.
- `synthetic_traits.csv`: Simulated trait data for these same samples, including 5 generalized traits with average values.
